## ðŸŽ¯ User Onboarding Guide

### For End Users

#### Getting Started
1. **Account Creation:**
   - Visit your deployed site
   - Click "Sign In" â†’ "Sign Up"
   - Choose preferred method (Email, Google, GitHub)
   - Complete profile setup

2. **First Music Generation:**
   - Navigate to "Generate Music"
   - Enter descriptive prompt (e.g., "Upbeat electronic dance music for a workout")
   - Select genre and mood
   - Adjust duration (15-120 seconds)
   - Click "Generate Music"
   - Wait for generation (typically 5-10 seconds)

3. **Managing Your Library:**
   - Access "Dashboard" to view all generated tracks
   - Play tracks directly from the library
   - Mark favorites with the heart icon
   - Download tracks for offline use
   - Share tracks on social media

#### Best Practices for Prompts

- **Include Context:** "Background music for a cooking video"
- **Specify Instruments:** "Acoustic guitar and soft vocals"
- **Mention Energy Level:** "High-energy", "relaxing", "intense"

### For Administrators

#### User Management
1. **Monitor User Activity:**
   - Check Clerk Dashboard for user registrations
   - Monitor Supabase for database activity
   - Review Vercel Analytics for usage patterns

2. **Handle Support Requests:**
   - Common issues: Login problems, generation failures
   - Check error logs in Vercel Functions
   - Verify service status (Clerk, Supabase)

## ðŸ”§ Admin/Maintenance Procedures

### Daily Monitoring

1. **Service Health Checks:**
   ```bash
   # Check application status
   curl -I https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/health
   
   # Verify database connectivity
   curl -I https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/db-health
   ```

2. **Key Metrics to Monitor:**
   - Response times (< 3 seconds)
   - Error rates (< 1%)
   - Generation success rate (> 95%)
   - User registration rate
   - Database connection pool usage

### Weekly Maintenance

1. **Database Cleanup:**
   ```sql
   -- Remove old anonymous user data (if any)
   DELETE FROM generated_tracks 
   WHERE created_at < NOW() - INTERVAL '90 days' 
   AND user_id IN (SELECT id FROM users WHERE email LIKE '%anonymous%');
   
   -- Analyze table performance
   ANALYZE generated_tracks;
   ANALYZE users;
   ANALYZE user_preferences;
   ```

2. **Performance Review:**
   - Check Vercel Analytics for Core Web Vitals
   - Review Supabase performance metrics
   - Monitor API rate limiting effectiveness

### Monthly Reviews

1. **Security Audit:**
   - Review Clerk security logs
   - Check for unusual API usage patterns
   - Verify SSL certificates are valid
   - Update dependencies if needed

2. **Cost Optimization:**
   - Review Vercel usage and billing
   - Monitor Supabase database size and requests
   - Optimize queries if needed

## ðŸš¨ Troubleshooting Common Issues

### User Authentication Issues

**Problem:** Users can't sign in
```bash
# Check Clerk service status
curl -I https://api.clerk.dev/v1/health

# Verify webhook is receiving events
# Check Vercel Function logs for webhook endpoint
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Clerk API keys in Vercel environment variables
2. Check if domain is properly configured in Clerk
3. Ensure webhook URL is accessible and returning 200

### Music Generation Failures

**Problem:** Generation requests failing
```bash
# Check API endpoint
curl -X POST https://your-domain.vercel.app/api/generate \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"prompt":"test","genre":"Pop","mood":"Happy","duration":30}'
```

**Solutions:**
1. Check rate limiting - user may have exceeded limits
2. Verify Supabase connection and RLS policies
3. Check if user is properly authenticated
4. Review API function logs in Vercel

### Database Connection Issues

**Problem:** Database queries failing
```sql
-- Check connection pool status
SELECT * FROM pg_stat_activity WHERE state = 'active';

-- Check table permissions
SELECT * FROM information_schema.table_privileges 
WHERE table_name IN ('users', 'generated_tracks', 'user_preferences');
```

**Solutions:**
1. Verify Supabase service status
2. Check connection string and credentials
3. Ensure RLS policies allow the operation
4. Monitor connection pool usage

### Performance Issues

**Problem:** Slow page loads or API responses

**Diagnostic Steps:**
1. **Check Core Web Vitals:**
   - Use Google PageSpeed Insights
   - Monitor Vercel Analytics

2. **Database Performance:**
   ```sql
   -- Check slow queries
   SELECT query, mean_time, calls 
   FROM pg_stat_statements 
   ORDER BY mean_time DESC 
   LIMIT 10;
   ```

3. **API Response Times:**
   - Check Vercel Function logs
   - Monitor cold start times

**Solutions:**
1. Optimize database queries and add indexes
2. Implement caching for frequently accessed data
3. Optimize bundle size and code splitting
4. Use Vercel Edge Functions for better performance

## ðŸ“ˆ Scaling Considerations

### Traffic Growth Planning

**Current Limits (Free Tiers):**
- Vercel: 100GB bandwidth, 100 serverless function executions
- Supabase: 500MB database, 2GB bandwidth
- Clerk: 10,000 monthly active users

**Scaling Thresholds:**
- **1,000+ users:** Consider Vercel Pro ($20/month)
- **10,000+ users:** Upgrade Supabase to Pro ($25/month)
- **50,000+ users:** Consider dedicated infrastructure

### Performance Optimization

1. **Database Scaling:**
   ```sql
   -- Add indexes for common queries
   CREATE INDEX CONCURRENTLY idx_tracks_user_created 
   ON generated_tracks(user_id, created_at DESC);
   
   -- Partition large tables if needed
   CREATE TABLE generated_tracks_2024 PARTITION OF generated_tracks
   FOR VALUES FROM ('2024-01-01') TO ('2025-01-01');
   ```

2. **Caching Strategy:**
   - Implement Redis for session caching
   - Use CDN for static assets
   - Cache user preferences and frequent queries

3. **API Optimization:**
   - Implement request batching
   - Add response compression
   - Use database connection pooling

### Infrastructure Upgrades

**Medium Scale (10K-100K users):**
- Vercel Pro with custom domains
- Supabase Pro with read replicas
- Implement monitoring with Datadog/New Relic

**Large Scale (100K+ users):**
- Consider multi-region deployment
- Implement microservices architecture
- Use dedicated AI service infrastructure
- Add load balancing and auto-scaling
